# Research Internships for Undergraduates

[Apply to manage this repository and receive mentorship → https://forms.gle/BhCrhXE8ZYsG7zw9A](:)

A curated — but non-exhaustive — list of research internships, summer programs, and short-term research opportunities aimed at undergraduate students. Many of the listed opportunities are especially relevant to students in India, but there are many global programs as well. This repository exists to help undergraduates discover research exposure and to make it easy for contributors to keep the list up to date.

About
This README collects active programs and links to help undergraduates (especially those from India) find short-term research internships and summer research programs. Links and program availability change often — please help us keep this list fresh by submitting issues or pull requests for broken links, updated eligibility, or new programs.

Who should use this list
- Undergraduate students seeking research internships (domestic or international)
- Students looking for summer research programs, short fellowships, or lab internships
- Faculty/students wanting a curated reference to share with peers

How to use this list
1. Search the Table of Contents for your region of interest.
2. Open program links to check eligibility, dates, stipends, and whether international applicants are accepted.
3. When applying: follow the program's application instructions (CV, statement of purpose, transcripts, faculty references, etc.).
4. Found a broken link or new program? Submit a PR or open an issue with the program details and source link.

How to contribute
- Add programs: Fork → edit the README in a new branch → submit a PR. Use the existing format: Program name (link) — short note about eligibility/location/notes.
- Report broken links: Open an issue with the broken URL and an updated link (if available).
- Curate duplicates or outdated entries: Propose edits via PR or open an issue for maintainers to review.
